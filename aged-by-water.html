  rippling lake surface. An arc of sandy tan traces through the otherwise soft
  blue water. The photograph has been printed in the center of a sheet of
  standard printer paper which has been crumpled and wetted with water, causing
  the ink to bleed in some spots."

    alt="Mixed media art: A double exposed film photograph of a lake. One of the
    exposures focuses on the horizon, a line of squat, tree covered mountains
    spanning the edge of a vast blue lake. The sky is partly cloudy. A floating
    barrier with yellow bouys starts at the bottom right and heads off into the
    horizon. The other exposure focuses on the surface of the same lake. Light
    reflects off the rippling water, creating bright sandy yellow reflections
    against an otherwise blue surface. The double exposure is offset slightly,
    although it is difficult to tell which photo is offset. The photograph is
    printed on standard printer paper, and has been crumpled and treated with
    water, causing some of the ink to bleed." />
